# Semi-Supervised-Segmentation-Pytorch
A work in progress repository for semi supervised image segmentation using Mean Teacher it includes the following features:

- Easy to train on new Train and Test sets using the provided notebook.
- Different Pre trained Networks.
- Many different Losses.
- TensorboardX integration. 
- Hyperparameter tuning. 
- Data Loader with Image Augmentation. 

TBD:
A learned GAN loss. Test on new dataset.
